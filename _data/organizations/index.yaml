  name: Apache Avro
  description: >-
    Apache Avro is a data serialization system. Avro relies on schemas. When
    Avro data is read, the schema used when writing it is always present. This
    permits each datum to be written with no per-value overheads, making
    serialization both fast and small. This also facilitates use with dynamic,
    scripting languages, since data, together with its schema, is fully
    self-describing.

    OData (Open Data Protocol) is an OASIS standard that defines the best
    practice for building and consuming RESTful APIs. OData helps you focus on
    your business logic while building RESTful APIs without having to worry
    about the approaches to define request and response headers, status codes,
    HTTP methods, URL conventions, media types, payload formats and query
    options etc.

    The Open API Initiative (OAI) was created by a consortium of forward-looking
    industry experts who recognize the immense value of standardizing on how
    REST APIs are described. As an open governance structure under the Linux
    Foundation, the OAI is focused on creating, evolving and promoting a vendor
    neutral description format. SmartBear Software is donating the Swagger
    Specification directly to the OAI as the basis of this Open Specification.

  name: RAML
  description: >-
    RESTful API Modeling Language (RAML) is a simple and succinct way of
    describing practically-RESTful APIs. It encourages reuse, enables discovery
    and pattern-sharing, and aims for merit-based emergence of best practices.
    The goal is to help our current API ecosystem by solving immediate problems
    and then encourage ever-better API patterns. RAML is built on broadly-used
    standards such as YAML and JSON and is a non-proprietary, vendor-neutral
    open spec.

    Semantic descriptions for hypermedia APIs. RESTdesc allows you to capture

    Despite their powerful capabilities, RESTdesc descriptions are easy to
    master. Description is not a goal in itself: you want your API to be used.
    See how RESTdesc opens up your API for discovery, based on its functional
    characteristics.
