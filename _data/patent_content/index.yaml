    When I can make time I read through patent filings from the USPTO. I have a
    regular script running that downloads new patent filings, and looks through
    them for keywords like API, Application Programming Interface, Hypermedia,
    and other buzzwords for the sector. These are the patents I've found that
    are related to this area of my research.

    If you have any questions about these patents, or know of other patents that
    I should have listed here, please feel free to reach out and submit a Github
    issue. I'm always looking for new patents, as well as legacy patents, or
    more important patent litigation that is occurring, and I depend on my
    audience and network to help keep me in tune.
