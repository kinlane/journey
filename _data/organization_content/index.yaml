    These are the organizations I come across in my research who are doing
    interesting things in the API space. They could be companies, institutions,
    government agencies, or any other type of organizational entity. My goal is
    to aggregate so I can stay in tune with what they are up to and how it
    impacts the API space.

    If you think there is an organization I should have listed here feel free to
    tweet it at me, or submit as a Github issue. Even though I do this full
    time, I'm still a one person show, and I miss quite a bit, and depend on my
    network to help me know what is going on.
