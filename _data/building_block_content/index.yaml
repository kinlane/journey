    As I study the API space, and profile the companies, services, and tooling I
    come across I'm always looking for the common building blocks in use across
    API operations. These are the features, and valuable elements of API
    operations, as well as companies who are servicing the API space.

    These building blocks are constantly being added to and reorganized. If
    there is something you think should be here feel free to let me know.
    Remember that this represents my living research, and will evolve, expand
    and actually seed new research areas as I find the time to pay attention to
    API definitions.
